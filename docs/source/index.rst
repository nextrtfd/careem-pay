Careem Pay Merchant Plugins - NodeJS API Documentation
=======================================================

**Disclaimer:** This project is experimental and the APIs are not considered stable.

The **Careem Pay Merchant Plugins** repository offers server-side code plugins to simplify integration with the **Careem Pay Merchant API**. Merchants can configure their credentials in an `.env` file and access CPay Merchant APIs with minimal additional code.

---------------------------
Overview
---------------------------

The **Careem Pay Merchant Plugin** for NodeJS allows merchants to integrate with Careem Pay's payment services easily. By configuring environment credentials, merchants can perform various payment-related operations without extensive setup.

---------------------------
Prerequisites
---------------------------

To test the API on localhost, you need to have:

- **NodeJS** (Latest LTS version recommended)
- **NPM** or **Yarn** for package management
- **Postman** to test endpoints
- **Careem Pay Merchant Onboarding**:
  - A registered merchant account on CPay.
  - Your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** issued by CPay.

---------------------------
Installation and Setup
---------------------------

Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Download or clone the source code from the repository.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - The repository contains the source code but does not include `node_modules`. At the root directory (where `index.js` is located), run either of the following commands:

   .. code-block:: bash

       npm install

   or

   .. code-block:: bash

       yarn

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Set up your `.env` file with the following variables:

     - `CLIENT_ID`: Your Careem Pay Client ID.
     - `CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Careem Pay Client Secret.
     - Any other required API-specific configurations.

4. **Start the Server**:
   - To simulate the endpoint on localhost, use one of the following commands:

   .. code-block:: bash

       npm start

   or

   .. code-block:: bash

       yarn start

5. **Testing with Postman**:
   - Use **Postman** to send requests to the endpoint and verify functionality.

---------------------------
API Endpoints

---------------------------
Running and Testing Locally
---------------------------

To test the plugin on your local machine:

1. Run the plugin using the start command:

   .. code-block:: bash

       npm start

2. Open **Postman** and configure it to interact with the pluginâ€™s endpoints. Use the authentication endpoint to retrieve an access token, and include this token in the headers of subsequent API requests.

---------------------------
Error Handling
---------------------------

The API includes standard error codes to identify the issues merchants may encounter:

- **400 Bad Request**: The request was invalid, possibly due to missing or incorrect parameters.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication failure, either due to an invalid client ID, client secret, or expired token.
- **403 Forbidden**: The merchant does not have permission to access the requested resource.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An error occurred on the server side. Contact support if the issue persists.
